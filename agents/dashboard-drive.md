# Dashboard — Drive agent

You produce the data that powers **Find palette** fuzzy search and the voice mic's **"open [file]"** intent on the user's Work Dashboard.

Identity (from the dashboard config / kickoff prompt):
- **User / timezone:** from the config (`user.email`, `user.timezone`).
- **Common workstream keywords** for quick classification: the config's `dashboard.classificationKeywords` (if set). Otherwise, no special weighting — just return recent files.

## What you do — fetch, dump raw. That's it.

**Resolve your Drive tool.** Your kickoff prompt names the Drive MCP server (default
**`Google_Drive`** — the standard managed connector), so the tool is normally
**`mcp__Google_Drive__list_recent_files`**. Try the `mcp__<server>__…` name from your
kickoff prompt first; then the **`claude_ai_`-prefixed** name
`mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__list_recent_files` (claude.ai-managed connectors use this
prefix); then the legacy `mcp__drive__list_recent_files`; if none resolve, call
**`ToolSearch`** with `query: "drive recent files"` and use what it surfaces (ToolSearch
only sees your frontmatter allowlist, which includes `claude_ai_`).

You have the Drive MCP tools, ToolSearch, and the Read + Write tools — no Bash. (If a
Write reports `drive-raw.json` already exists from a stale run, Read it once then Write
again.) This is
deliberate: an agent that can't emit bash can't trip Claude Code's permission prompt. The
tedious mimeType→kind / URL / timestamp / dedup math lives in a committed script
(`drive-transform.py`) that **the orchestrator runs for you** after you finish — you do
NOT run it. Your entire job is: **fetch → dump raw → output one character.**

1. Call `list_recent_files` **once** for files the user owned or edited in the **last 14 days**. **Cap at 25 results** — do NOT page for more, and do **NOT** call `get_file_metadata`. The list endpoint returns enough (`id`, `name`, `mimeType`, `modifiedTime`, `owners`). The single call takes 30–45s and is the dominant cost — more calls is the wrong move.
2. **Write the raw response verbatim** to `<dataCacheDir>/drive-raw.json` using the **Write tool**. Preserve every field — especially `id`, `name`, `mimeType`, `modifiedTime`, and `owners` — for each file. A bare array `[ {...}, {...} ]` is fine, as is `{ "files": [...] }`.
3. Output `✓` and stop. The orchestrator's `wait-and-merge.sh` then runs `drive-transform.py`, which reads `drive-raw.json`, applies all the mapping/dedup/cap/exclude rules below, and writes `drive.json`. (If your MCP fetch failed, instead Write `drive.json` directly with `sourceOk:false` per the failure rule and output `✗`.)

You do **not** hand-build the JSON below, and you do **not** run the transform — the orchestrator does. It's documented here only so you can eyeball `drive.json` afterward. The script's mapping:

## Output (produced by the transform script)

The script writes `<dataCacheDir>/drive.json`. Schema:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz0123456789",
      "title": "Q2 OKRs",
      "kind": "sheet",
      "url": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz0123456789/edit",
      "modified": "2026-04-22T14:12:00+02:00",
      "modifiedLabel": "yesterday",
      "owner": "me"
    }
  ],
  "generatedAt": "2026-04-23T19:08:00+02:00",
  "sourceOk": true,
  "error": null
}
```

### Field reference
- `kind` — map from mimeType:
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.document` → `doc`
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet` → `sheet`
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.presentation` → `slide`
  - `application/pdf` → `pdf`
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.folder` → `folder`
  - anything else → `other`
- `url` — must be a direct-edit link for Google-native types (doc/sheet/slide use `/edit`), else the Drive file-view URL.
- `modifiedLabel` — relative to **now** in the user's timezone: `today` (same calendar day), `yesterday`, `Nd ago` (2–6 days), `Nw ago` (1–4 weeks), `Nmo ago` (older, up to 12mo).
- `owner` — `me` if the user is owner; else the other owner's display name (cap 30 chars).

## Rules
- **Cap**: 25 files max (most recent first). If `list_recent_files` returns more, drop the oldest.
- **Exclude**: shared-with-me files the user has never opened, Trash, files named `Untitled` (likely draft noise).
- **Title truncation**: cap at 80 chars in the JSON; the dashboard truncates further for display.
- **URL correctness**: wrong URLs break the voice "open" intent — verify the URL pattern matches the kind before writing.
- **Cap/exclude/URL/timestamp logic is enforced by the transform script the orchestrator runs** — you don't reproduce it; just dump the raw response faithfully so the script has the fields it needs.
- If the `list_recent_files` MCP call itself fails: Write `drive.json` directly with `"sourceOk": false`, `"error": "<reason>"`, `"files": []`, and output `✗`. (In this case there's no useful `drive-raw.json`, so the orchestrator's transform is a no-op and your `drive.json` stands.)
- Your only stdout is **exactly one character**: `✓` once you've written `drive-raw.json` successfully, or `✗` on MCP failure. No other text — no path, no counts, no debug. The orchestrator runs the transform and reads the JSON via `build-overrides.py`.

## Why JSON (vs regenerating drive-index.jsx directly)
Two reasons: (1) the skill decides when to rewrite `drive-index.jsx` and bump its `?v=N` cache param, (2) the user can eyeball the JSON to confirm the right files showed up before the dashboard reloads. Keeps this agent swappable.
