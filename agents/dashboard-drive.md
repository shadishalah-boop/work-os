# Dashboard — Drive agent

You produce the data that powers **Find palette** fuzzy search and the voice mic's **"open [file]"** intent on the user's Work Dashboard.

The kickoff prompt includes: user name, user email, and the output directory.

## What you do

1. Call `list_recent_files` to get files the user owned or edited in the last **14 days**. Stop at 25 items — the Find palette only needs the most recent slice.
2. Dedupe by file ID. Rank by `modifiedTime` descending.
4. For each file, extract:
   - `title` — file name
   - `id` — Drive file ID
   - `url` — `https://docs.google.com/<type>/d/<id>/edit` for Docs/Sheets/Slides, otherwise `https://drive.google.com/file/d/<id>/view`
   - `kind` — `doc | sheet | slide | pdf | folder | other`
   - `modified` — ISO timestamp
   - `modifiedLabel` — human-relative: `today | yesterday | Nd ago | Nw ago | Nmo ago`
   - `owner` — `me` if the user owns it, else the owner's display name (cap 30 chars)

## Output

Write to `<output_dir>/drive.json`. Schema:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "1JCV...",
      "title": "Q2 OKRs · Strategy team",
      "kind": "sheet",
      "url": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JCV.../edit",
      "modified": "2026-04-22T14:12:00+02:00",
      "modifiedLabel": "yesterday",
      "owner": "me"
    }
  ],
  "generatedAt": "2026-04-23T19:08:00+02:00",
  "sourceOk": true,
  "error": null
}
```

### Field reference
- `kind` — from mimeType:
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.document` → `doc`
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet` → `sheet`
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.presentation` → `slide`
  - `application/pdf` → `pdf`
  - `application/vnd.google-apps.folder` → `folder`
  - else → `other`
- `url` — direct-edit link for Google-native types (doc/sheet/slide use `/edit`), else Drive file-view URL.
- `modifiedLabel` — relative to **now** in user's timezone.
- `owner` — `me` if the user owns; else other owner's display name.

## Rules
- **Cap**: 25 files max (most recent first). Drop oldest.
- **Exclude**: shared-with-me files the user has never opened, Trash, files named `Untitled` (likely draft noise).
- **Title**: cap at 80 chars.
- **URL correctness**: wrong URLs break the voice "open" intent — verify the URL pattern matches the kind.
- If Drive API fails: write with `"sourceOk": false`, `"error": "<reason>"`, `"files": []`.
- Your only stdout is **exactly one character**: `✓` if you wrote the JSON with `sourceOk: true`, `✗` if `sourceOk: false`. No other text — no path, no counts, no debug. The orchestrator reads the JSON via `build-overrides.py`.

## Why JSON
Skill decides when to regenerate drive-index.jsx and bump its cache param.
